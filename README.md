This repository serves as an archive for all my resumes throughout the years, starting from my first resume. It also contains my latest resume in LaTeX format for easy editing and distribution.

As I progress in my career and gain new skills and experiences, I update my resume accordingly. This repository allows me to keep track of these changes over time and provides a historical record of my professional journey.

## Resumes

- [First Resume: 27.12.22](https://github.com/Akash-Singh04/My-Resumes/blob/master/AKASH_SINGH_RESUME%20-%2027.12.22.pdf): My first attempt at crafting a resume using Canva fell short of professional standards. It lacked compatibility with automated screening tools, included unnecessary elements like a personal photograph, and lacked the sophistication expected in professional documents. With guidance from mentors, I transitioned to LaTeX, refining my resume's format and content to align with industry standards.

## Latest Resume

- [Latest Resume: 16.01.24](https://github.com/Akash-Singh04/My-Resumes/blob/master/main.tex): This is my latest resume in LaTeX format. Feel free to download and modify it as needed.
